# Hackathon

## Solution for the Task

In this repository you will find the code to solve the problem that was assigned to us. I chose one difficulty level for myself: basic. Solution_pipeline.py has been updated and my code has been inserted there. The predictions are close but I don't know why they're not always correct.

I used for this task:

- Visual Code Studio.
- Library OpenCV(cv2).
- Convolution kernel: cv2.blur.
- Convolution kernel: cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY).
- List: predict_array = [].
- Function: cv2.HoughCircles() to find circles.
- df_answer = pd.DataFrame.
- Images for prediction.
