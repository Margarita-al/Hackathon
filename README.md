# Hackathon
## Solution for the Task
In this repository, you will find the code to solve the problem that was assigned to us. \n I chose one difficulty level for myself: basic. \n Solution_pipelines. py has been updated, and my code has been inserted there, slightly corrected. \n The predictions are close, but I don't know why, they're not always correct.
